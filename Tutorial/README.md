# CGSB Tutorial

For a detailed introduction to the software, please consult [CGSB Documentation](../CGSB_Documentation.pdf).

For a quick reminder of available commands, you can use the [Cheat Sheet](../CGSB_Cheat_Sheet.pdf).

This tutorial is available as a Jupyter Notebook and it systematically presents build procedures, from very simple to very complex systems.

It includes:

* **Basic system**: A simple POPC membrane in solvent (water + 0.15 M NaCl)

![](../figures/basic_system.png)

* **Simple system**: A symmetric complex membrane (POPC and CHOL) in solvent

![](../figures/simple_system.png)

* **Membrane with protein system**: A symmetric complex membrane with a specified membrane APL and a transmembrane protein

![](../figures/protein_in_membrane.png)

* **Asymmetric membrane system**: An asymmetric complex membrane with bespoke APL values in each leaflet

* **Protein in solvent**: A protein in water and 0.15 M NaCl, without a membrane

* **Phase-separated system**: A membrane with defined patches of different compositions

![](../figures/phase_separated_system.png)

* **Phase-separated system generator**: Code for creating a customisable grid of membrane patches

![](../figures/phase_separated_generator.png)

* **Multiple bilayers system**: Two membranes offset in the z direction

* **Monolayer system**: An upper-facing complex monolayer

* **Mixed solvent system**: A symmetric complex membrane solvated with regular and small water beads in specified ratios

![](../figures/mixed_solvent.png)

* **Flooding system**: A membrane system that has been flooeded with solute molecules, followed by solvation

* **Abstract art**: Just for fun
